# Recipe bundle

## About the project

Recipe Bundle (I welcome catchy names!) is an application developed with one goal in mind: simplifying the proces of planning your week menu with your own personal recipes in one central place. The long run goal is to create the opportunity to generate a grocery list based on the ingredients of the selected recipes. The issue tab may give an insight on short term focuses, but is in no means the complete backlog of planned things.

This application exists of two main components: a front-end application and a back-end server. Both directive contain their own logic and their how to's are explained in their own readme-files.
